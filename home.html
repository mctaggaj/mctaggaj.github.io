<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    My name is Jason McTaggart, I am a computer science student in the coop program at the University of Guelph, minoring in business administration.
    I choose to apply to a coop program to supplement my formal education with real world experience.
    Throughout the coop program I have worked in a variety of roles, each of witch gave me new technical skills and helped me to hone my soft skills, such as communication and teamwork.
    Most of my experience is focused client side development, including iOS and web applications, that is not to say that I do not have a passion for backend development.
    Being able to understand and develop both front and backend applications should be part of every developers skill set.

<h2>Spare Time</h2>
<p>
    In my spare time I enjoy staying active with a wide range of outdoor activities.
    In the warmer months I am always on the move, from ultimate freebie and kayaking to biking.
    During the winter you'd be hard pressed to find me off the slopes as I coach competitive freestyle snowboarding on the weekends.
