<p>If you are a web developer you are doubtlessly familiar with CSS frameworks such as bootstrap that provide a grid framework. A lot of web developers start off using one of these frameworks but when design requirements escalate the frameworks have a hard time keeping up. Some developers drop the framework all together developing solutions on the fly where others keep this large framework around for it’s grid functionality. Through the LESS features discussed in my previous posts I have developed Ossibus, a lightweight, configureable grid framework that creates a grid system similar to bootstrap that developers can edit to their hearts content. This post will serve as a instruction manual for configuring the Ossibus framework.</p>

<p>As a general rule of thumb I try to keep all my variables separate from my code, whether that means using a separate file of just keeping them at the top of my code. In this case I have placed all the variables in a separate file. Have a look at the “variables.less” file in src/less. All the configurations can be made here. First lets take a look at the responsive section, you will notice there is a variable for each each screen size. There are five different form factors we take into consideration, extra small (xs), small (sm), medium (md), large (lg), and extra large (xl). The breakpoints of these form factors call all be configured here. Next we see the list of media queries for each form factor. Most users will not need to change these.</p>

<p>Moving down to the Cols section, first we see the separator; this is the string that is inserted in-between words in Ossibus’s classes as a convention. Feel free to change this variable and watch the entire library go from dash separated to underscore separated. You will also see variables for configuring the names of the classes. The colPrefix variable configures what the name of the class starts with, it is followed by a number (the size) then the appropriate suffix. Here, you can also configure then number of columns and the float direction. Next is the Spacing section, here you can edit the max width of your page along with the gutter size. At the moment the spacing is not implemented for each individual form factor, I’m currently evaluating the value of reimplementing it in a form factor my form factor basis.</p>

<p>I wish for Ossibus to remain an open source project, therefor if there you have any requests please submit a feature request. If you wish to make the changes yourself please ensure that the changes are configurable from the variables file and submit a pull request. New contributors are welcome!</p>
