<h1>Sandbox Software</h1>
<p>
    From May to September 2015 I worked as a web developer for <a href="https://www.sandboxsoftware.ca" target="_blank">Sandbox Software</a>.
    I spent the majority of my time developing websites in Sandbox's proprietary CMS (Content Management System) <i>Oassis</i>, the sites I developed ranged from simple lightweight sites such as <a href="https://hospicewellington.org" target="_blank">Hospice Wellington</a> to more complicated cites such as <a href="http://www.walterfedy.com/">Walter Fedy</a>.
    My job consisted of implementing website designs in such a way that they can be managed in <i>Oassis</i> and communicating with clients and designers.
    To enable me to better respond to feedback from stakeholders, I used a tool called LESS.
    LESS is a dynamic stylesheet language that complies down to CSS; it introduces powerful tools that allow developers to think of stylesheets more as a programing language than traditional CSS.
    I have developed tutorials for a few tent pole features of LESS that benefited my development the most, <a href="#/coop3/LESS_Variables">variables</a>, <a href="#/coop3/LESS_Nesting">nesting</a> and <a href="#/coop3/LESS_Mixins">mixins</a>.

    At the beginning of my term at Sandbox I was a strong supported of <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, all of my previous work in web development had relied heavily on bootstrap for it's grid system and it's general styling.
    Bootstrap is a very powerful framework and I would advise every web developer to familiarize themselves with it, however the level of customization needed for the projects I was given made Bootstrap's general styling not an option.
    This presented me with a dilemma, I either had to make my own grid system or use bootstrap's, unnecessarily bloating my sites.
    For the first site I did I used Bootstrap, this worked well enough, however my obsession with efficiency kept me thinking about how I would approach developing my own grid system.
    I Quickly realized that developing the framework in a dynamic stylesheet language was the only reasonable choice; I was most familiar with LESS and support for it was already built into <i>Oassis</i>, so I used LESS.
    I began by spending my spare time reading about every feature in LESS and there are a lot of them.
    I learnt a lot features that I have only used a handful of times since and a few that I use all the time.
    The most notable feature I learned about is <a href="http://lesscss.org/features/#mixin-guards-feature">mixin guards</a>.
    This feature allows you to build recursive mixins among other things.
    I used mixin guards when developing the grid framework, reducing the about of code repetition dramatically.
    Through meany iterations, on meany different sites I developed a pretty sold grid framework that with a simple variable change, could modify the number of columns.
    Since then I've started developing a new open source grid framework that I've titled Ossibus.
    The goal of Ossibus is to achieve complete grid configurability trough variables.
    I've made a pretty sold first attempt at this and intend to continue development.
    Please take a look at it on <a href="https://github.com/mctaggaj/ossibus">GitHub</a> and check out my <a href="#/coop3/Ossibus
    ">tutorial</a> of how to customize it.

    Another think I was responsible for wat ensuring all of the websites I developed met their <a href="http://accessontario.com/aoda/" target="_blank">AODA</a> requirement.
    AODA stand for "Accessibility For Ontarians With Disabilities Act" and yes it is a law.
    I know sounds like pretty boring stuff but what it boils down to is websites must be accessible and usable by those with disabilities.
    Most of it is for visual disabilities such as supporting screen readers for the blind and other visual disabilities.
    Once you wrap your head around the basic concepts it not too big of a deal.
    A tool that I used to test AODA compliance is <a href="http://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank">Wave</a>, I strongly encourage all web developers to take a use this tool as part of their development process.
