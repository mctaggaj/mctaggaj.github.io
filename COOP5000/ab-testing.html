<h1>A/B Testing</h1>
<p>
    Organizations are always looking for ways to create more value, they see something that they can do cheaper or something they can charge more for and make the necessary changes.
    The free app business is no different, however due to the electronic nature it can go about things more scientifically.
    Say for example the product owner think that by moving 'button X' from one place to another will increase a DAU (daily active users).
    Through the use of A/B testing we can segment users and determine writer or not it is true.

    A/B testing allows us to scientifically try out new things and measure their impact, wile limiting business risk.
    Terminology learnt in statistics helped me pick up this strategy and how it works.
    Basically the test group is split into multiple groups each with different variables.
    Then a goal is set, for example maximize purchases, and after a pre determined amount of time, the experiment is concluded and results are measured.
    If the goal is met with statistically significance then the winning variant is adopted across the entire user base, with the exception of the occurrence of negative, unexpected consequences.
    Being able to safely and scientifically make business optimizations provides the confidence to try new things, while minimizing extra risk.
