<h1>Wrapping up at TextNow</h1>
<p>
    After eight months of working at TextNow I can conclude that it is my favourite placement.
    Itâ€™s social environment encourages teamwork that aids in a productive learning environment.
    Another thing I enjoyed was that all employees are treated fairly and equally.
    I found this to help not only the development of my technical skills but also my understanding of the business.
    This is knowledge that I will be able to apply no matter where I put my skills to use.

    Over the duration of my placement I have accomplished meany of my long time goals.
    I wrote my first server and android code, rediscovered iOS/Objective-C all wile honing my web development skills.
    These past eight months I was able to develop my communication skill.
    With several teammates working remotely not a day went by where I did not put them to use.
    This lead to me developing a greater ability to communicate my ideas with others.

    TextNow is a great fit for me, I will be returning for full time employment once I have received my degree.
    In the mean time I will work part time, my goal is to achieve 20 hours a week; one day of witch will be in the office.
    I hope to further develop my communication skills through this period as working remotely requires a greater ability to communicate.
