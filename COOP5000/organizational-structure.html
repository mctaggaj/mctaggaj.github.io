<h1>Organizational Structure</h1>
<p>
    As an organization TextNow has a very flat structure.
    All developers report directly to the lead developer who reports to the CEO.
    This translates into engineers having a lot of influence in the product and the organizations as a whole.
    On top of this each TextNow employee has access to real time key performance indicators.
    This enables any employees to open dialog on recent changes and expected outcomes on upcoming changes.
    In contrast to other companies where employees need to jump through hoops just to have their ideas and concerns heard.
    TextNow actively encourages all employees to provide feedback and suggestions, employee “buy in” is very important.
    After all if your employees are not confident in the product and it’s road map how can users be.
