<h1>Header Bidding</h1>
<h2>Optimization</h2>
<p>
    Another advantages of header bidding is customization, simply put there are a lot of ways to optimize the implementation.
    An example of an optimization that can have a profound impact is the bid timeout.
    Bid timeout is used to limit the amount of time given to bidders to respond.

<p>
    Restricting the amount of time advertisers have to respond is necessary because advertisers may take a long time or never respond at all.
    Depending on what advertisers you work with they may request certain bid timeouts or optimize for your timeout.
    However in my experience the best way to optimize the timeout is by using analytics, one way to do this is report each and every event to a central database.
    On this date set you can run queries to determine the optimal bid timeout, using trial and error you can simulate different bid timeouts without effecting revenue.
    Then once you have found the bid timeout that maximizes revenue, you can publish it to the client.

<p>
    This is only one example of an optimization that can be preformed however the more data you collect the more likely you are to find new ways to optimize your setup.
    Additional benefits of gathering performance data is real time, reporting and health monitoring.
    You can setup systems to query your data-set at an interval reporting potential problems days before traditional ad reporting would.
