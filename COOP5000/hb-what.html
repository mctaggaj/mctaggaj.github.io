<h1>Header Bidding</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>
    Internet advertising is one of the most mature internet age industries, and it continues to grow every year.
    We’ve been using the current system for over 6 years and in the internet era that is a a long time, even for a large industry.
    However there is a new technology on its way that takes advantage of the internet’s advancements.

    Enter header bidding, the latest in internet advertising helps improve average CPM by increasing competition between advertisers.
    Header bidding holds a real time auction for each ad impression on the client.
    To accomplish this the publisher sends a request to each advertiser with information about the placement and potentially the user, the advertiser then responds with an ad and a bid.
    Once all the bids are back or a predetermined duration has elapsed the advertiser chooses the most favourable bid (normally the highest bidder) and displays the ad associated with it.

    Header bidding is an economists dream, it creates an environment that promotes near perfect competition on a micro level.
    Each impression is guaranteed to maximize it's CPM.
    Any number of bidding partners can be used, only increasing competition as new ones are added.
