<h1>TextNow</h1>
<p>
    For my last 8 months of coop I will be working at TextNow, the creator of a free texting app and mobile carrier in the United States.
    My role will be Web Developer, I will be working on a team of seven with the objective of maximizing company growth.
    I along with my manager will maintain and improve <a href="https://www.textnow.com">www.textnow.com</a>.
</p>

    Over the course of this placement I hope to further develop my web development skills.
    The main framework I will be working on in BackboneJS.
    I have never worked with Backbone before however I'm keen to broaden my stack, and improve the breadth of my abilities.
    Another Framework I will be working in is AngularJs, with witch I'm very familiar.
    I spent my first two coop placements working in angular and I have loved it ever since.
    On top of the java script libraries I will also be using SCSS.
    SCSS is a language built on top of css, it is very similar to LESS, a similar language that I have spent a lot of time developing in.
