<h1>Pull Requests</h1>
<p>
    At TextNow every change to the code base must be submitted in the form of a pull request.
    (PR for short) Each PR must be approved by at least two other developers, one being a expert on the code base, the other can be anything from a coop to another subject matter expert.
    Pull request help enforce good coding practices such as design, style and documentation.

    Up to this point I have submitted meany PRs, most small buf fixes but also a few small features.
    I find that knowing that someone is going to look at my code when I'm done improves it's overall quality.
    Further more it encourages me, the developer to look over my own code first to avoid waisting the time of the code reviewers.

    Pull requests are a critical part of my job.
    Together the developer, QA and code reviewers share the burden of ensuring the functionality not only meets spec but also meets the userâ€™s needs.
    This is a responsibility not be taken lightly, if something goes wrong this group is responsible.
    Not only is being able to effectively code review required to maintain employment it is also necessary to ensure the company remains successful.
    In light of this I am surprised that I have not been required to do a single PR.
    I hope PRs make their way into the curriculum in the future as most developers will be required to execute them over the course of their career.
