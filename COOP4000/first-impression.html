<h1>Onboarding</h1>
<p>
    The TextNow onboarding process leaves little to be desired.
    My first day was spent working on very minor bugs (mostly styling), this allowed me to get a feel for the application and how to navigate around the major components.
    The next few days were spent on the messaging app, also fixing bugs however this time they were javascript bugs.
    This gave me the opportunity to learn the standards used, the structure of the codebase and Backbone it's self.
    Backbone it's self was a little hard to wrap my head around, being from a Angular background I a used to getting a lot of powerful features for free where Backbone requires a lot of boilerplate code.
    This confusion was compounded by the fact that the same templating language is used for server side and client side rendering.
    A few days was perfect to gain a grasp of Backbone and the standards used by TextNow.

    As the days went on my level of independence grew, I began working on small features and major bugs.
    This required an even stronger grasp of the system, and it was the perfect situation to develop it.
    Every day larger and larger task were given to me, and every day I required less oversight.

    I find that this process for onboarding a new developer is optimal.
    Not only was it enjoyable for me, but I was also able to gain a strong grasp of the system in a relatively short period of time.
    This stand in stark contrast to my experience at my previous placements the first of witch I spent my first 3 weeks developing throw away code.
